    "\n",
    "3 parts to a proof\n",
    "* Initialization: it is true (in a limited sense) before the loop runs\n",
    "* Maintenance: if it's true before an iteration of a loop, it remaine true before the next iteration.\n",
    "* Termination: it will terminate in a useful way once it is finished.\n",
    "\n",
    "Say we have some InsertionSort code, where the outer loop goes through the whole array 'a'\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "a = [3, 2, 21, 1, 5, 4, 2, 6, 8, 7, 2]\n",
    "for i in range(len(a)):\n",
    "    pass \n",

    "\n",
    "> At the start of every iteration of the outer loop (indexed with i), the subarray until **ar\\[i\\]** consists of the original elements that were there, but in sorted order\n",
    "\n",
    "To prove Insertion Sort is correct, you will then demonstrate it for the three stages:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Initialization - The subarray starts with the first element of the array, and it is (obviously) sorted to begin with.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Maintenance - Each iteration of the loop expands the subarray, but keeps the sorted property. An element ***V*** gets inserted into the array only when it is greater than the element to its left. Since the elements to its left have already been sorted, it means ***V*** is greater than all the elements to its left, so the array remains sorted. (In Insertion Sort 2 we saw this by printing the array each time an element was properly inserted.)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Termination - The code will terminate after ***i*** \n",
    "has reached the last element in the array, which means the sorted subarray has expanded to encompass the entire array. The array is now fully sorted.\n"
