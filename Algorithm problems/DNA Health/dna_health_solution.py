# A reattempt at the DNA health problem.
# About 6 months ago I attempted this problem. Since then a 
#   lot has changed and I've learned so much.

# First, off, why didn't I use dictionaries when I originally
#   attempted this problem???  Like, seriously...

# Output format: 
# Print two space-separated integers describing the 
#   respective total health of the unhealthiest and
#   the healthiest strands of DNA.

## Sample input (see problem's page for more details)
#    6
#    a b c aa d b
#    1 2 3 4 5 6
#    3
#    1 5 caaab
#    0 4 xyz
#    2 4 bcdybc

# Output result (see older file for explanation)
#   0 19

# some thoughts
# make a tree where the path along the tree is each 
#   character. 
# For instance consider the following
#
#   gene pool: [abcd, a, ab, ac, ad, bc, cd, a, bb, bcd, abcd, aaaa, aa, a ]
#   health   : [ 11,  3, 4,  5,  1,  20,  0, 6, 13,  15,  56,   99,  38, 45]
#
# will translate to the following tree:


example = {
    'a': {
        'end': 3 + 6 + 45,
        'a': {
            'end': 38,
            'a': {
                'a': {
                    'end': 99
                },
            },
            'b': {
                'end': 1
            }
        },
        'b': {
            'end': 4,
            'a': {
                'end': 8
            },
            'c': {
                'd': {
                    'end': 11 + 56
                }
            }
        },
        'c': {
            'end': 5
        },
        'd': {
            'end': 1
        },
    },
    'b': {
        'b': {
            'end': 13
        },
        'c': {
            'end': 20,
            'd': {
                'end': 15
            }
        }
    },

        'd': {
            'end': 0

}


# This is achieved with build_health_tree. This tree is built on
# the "first" pass over the gene pool.
# Think of this gene pool as a machine filter

# The next step is feeding the dna string, Ã  la a tap feed on
#  a turing machine.

# The machine will check if the character on the dna str is
#   a key in the first dictionary. If so, move inside this
#   dictionary.
#
#   Check if there is an 'end' key in the inner dictionary,
#   if so, add the value to the total health value.
#  
#   Now, Increment to the next char on the dna
#   string. 
#   
#   Repeat the above steps until a key can't be found. 
#   Reset back to the first character and move forward 1 
#   char. 
#   
#   Repeat this whole process.
#
#   However, this can be sped up.
#
# On the other hand it should be possible to make a single pass
#   without back tracking at all.
#
#   Keep a dynamic list of dictionaries, that grows and shrinks
#   over time.
#   
#   For instance, using the example dictionary from earlier,
#   consider the following dna str

#dna_str = 'aabb'

# our dynamic list of dictionaries followes these rules:
# dyn = []
#   look at index 0 of dna_str 
#   since 'a' is in the gene pool, add it to our list
# dyn = [ a ]    (remember this is a list of dictionaires, I'm simply representing them with their keys)
#   move inside the health_tree[a]
#   check for 'end' key at this branch.
#   look at the next index in the dna_str
#   Is the char 'a' a branch on the inner dictionary?
#   yes,
#   move within that dictionary 
#   so update [a] to now be [ aa ]
#   Additionally, is 'a' a branch on the root? 
#   Yes, add it to our list
#   our list now contains [aa, a]
#   
#   next char index for dna_str (at this point we've looked up to 'aab')
#   is 'b' a key in any of the dictionaries within our list. 
#   Yes, in the dictionary 'aa' and dictionary 'a' and in root dictionary
#   So, you now have list of dictionaries [aab, ab, b]
#   
#   look at the 4th char.
#   check key 'b' for each dictionary in the list of dicts.
#       'b' is NOT a key for dict "aab"
#           drop that dictionary as we have exhausted it.
#       'b' is NOT a key for dict "ab"
#           drop that dictionary as we have exhausted it.
#       'b' IS a key for dictionary "b"
#       
#       And also 'b' is a starting key.
#
#   the dynamic list of dictionaries is now [bb, b]
#


# overall order of operations for calculating health value
# for dictionary in dyn_dictionary_list:
# if dna[i] is a key in dictionary: 
#   dyn_dictionary_list[d] =
